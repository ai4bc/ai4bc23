In domains as wide-ranging as medication adherence, vaccination, college
enrollment, retirement savings, and energy consumption, behavioral interventions
have been shown to encourage people towards making better choices. For many
applications of AI in these areas, one needs to design systems that learn to
motivate people to take actions that maximize their welfare. Large data sources,
both conventionally used in social sciences (EHRs, health claims, credit card use,
college attendance records) and unconventional (social networks, fitness apps), are
now available, and are increasingly used to personalize interventions. These
datasets can be leveraged to learn individualsâ€™ behavioral patterns, identify
individuals at risk of making sub-optimal or harmful choices, and target them with
behavioral interventions to prevent harm or improve well-being. At the same time,
there is an increasing interest in AI in moving beyond traditional supervised
learning approaches towards learning causal models, which can support the
identification of targeted behavioral interventions. These research trends inform the
need to explore the intersection of AI with behavioral science and causal inference,
and how they can come together for applications in the social and health sciences.


This workshop will focus on AI and ML-based approaches that can (1) identify
individuals in need of behavioral interventions, and/or predict when they need
them; (2) help design and target optimal interventions; and (3) exploit
observational and/or experimental datasets in domains including social media,
health records, claims data, fitness apps, etc. for causal estimation in the behavior
science world.
